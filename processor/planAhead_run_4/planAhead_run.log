CRITICAL WARNING: [Designutils 20-1022] Could not resolve non-primitive black box cell 'keyboard' instantiated in module 'keyboard_imp'.
Resolution: File names need to match cell names: an EDIF definition will be found in keyboard.edf; a HDL definition may be placed in any Verilog/VHDL file.

WARNING: [Netlist 29-43] Netlist 'processor' is not ideal for floorplanning, since the cellview 'processor' defined in file 'processor.ngc' contains large number of primitives.  Please consider enabling hierarchy in synthesis if you want to do floorplanning.
